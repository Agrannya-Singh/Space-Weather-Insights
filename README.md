# Solar Dashboard 

## Welcome to the Solar Activity Dashboard! ‚òÄÔ∏è

This project provides a visually appealing and informative dashboard to track solar activity events using data from NASA's Space Weather Database of Notifications, Knowledge, and Information (DONKI). Built with the power of Next.js and Firebase, this application offers a seamless and engaging experience for exploring the dynamic nature of our sun.

### ‚ú® Key Features:

*   **Real-time Data:** Stay updated with the latest solar events directly from the NASA DONKI database.
*   **Interactive Visualizations:** Explore solar flares, coronal mass ejections (CMEs), and other events through charts and maps.
*   **Detailed Event Information:** Dive into the specifics of each event with comprehensive descriptions and relevant data points.
*   **AI-Powered Summaries:** Get concise and insightful summaries of events generated by AI.
*   **Built‚Äëin EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):** Upload or paste JSON/CSV at `/eda` to auto‚Äëanalyze datasets (type inference, missingness, distributions, categorical frequencies, and time series) with interactive charts.
*   **User-Friendly Interface:** Navigate the dashboard with ease thanks to a clean and intuitive design.

### üöÄ Tech Stack:

*   **Next.js:** A powerful React framework for building fast and scalable web applications.
*   **Firebase:** A comprehensive platform providing backend services like hosting, authentication, and databases.
*   **Genkit:** Integrated for AI capabilities, specifically for generating event summaries.
*   **NASA DONKI API:** The source of our fascinating solar activity data.
*   **Shadcn UI:** A beautiful and accessible UI component library.
*   **Tremor:** Used for building stunning and interactive charts.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid styling.

### üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started:

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Install dependencies: `npm install`
3.  Set up your Firebase project and configure the necessary environment variables.
4.  Run the development server: `npm run dev`
5.  Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:9002` (dev port) to explore the dashboard.
6.  EDA is available at `http://localhost:9002/eda`.


### üõ∞Ô∏è NASA DONKI API Integration:

This project proudly utilizes data from the NASA Space Weather Database of Notifications, Knowledge, and Information (DONKI) API. This API provides a wealth of information about solar and geophysical events that can affect Earth.

*   **API Endpoint:** The data is fetched from the following endpoint: `https://api.nasa.gov/DONKI/`

*   **Getting Your Own API Key:** To use the NASA APIs, including DONKI, you will need an API key. You can obtain a free API key by following the instructions on the official NASA API website: [https://api.nasa.gov/](https://api.nasa.gov/)

    1.  Visit the NASA API website.
    2.  Click on "Generate API Key".
    3.  Fill out the required information and agree to the terms of service.
    4.  Your API key will be displayed on the screen and also sent to your email address.

We extend our sincere gratitude to NASA for providing the invaluable data through the DONKI database.

## üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Navigate to `/eda` to analyze datasets:
  - Paste a JSON array or CSV text, or upload a `.json`/`.csv` file
  - Overview: row/field counts, missingness, type inference, samples
  - Numeric: summary statistics and histograms
  - Categorical: top frequencies
  - Time series: counts grouped by date when a time field is detected


## üê≥ Docker

Build and run a production image:

```bash
docker build -t space-weather-insights:prod .
docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env --name space-weather space-weather-insights:prod
```

Environment variables (example):

```bash
NASA_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY
NODE_ENV=production
```


## üß™ CI/CD with Jenkins

This repo includes a `Jenkinsfile` that runs:
- Install dependencies (`npm ci`)
- Lint and typecheck (`npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`)
- Build (`npm run build`)
- Build (and optionally push) Docker image

Set up Jenkins credentials for your registry and configure environment variables as needed.
