# Solar Dashboard 

## Welcome to the Solar Activity Dashboard! ‚òÄÔ∏è

This project provides a visually appealing and informative dashboard to track solar activity events using data from NASA's Space Weather Database of Notifications, Knowledge, and Information (DONKI). Built with the power of Next.js and Firebase, this application offers a seamless and engaging experience for exploring the dynamic nature of our sun. a custom EDA engine in TypeScript that automates the generation of 5+ chart types, reducing manual
analysis time by an estimated 80%

deployment via docker : https://space-weather-insights.onrender.com

*   **Firebase:** A comprehensive platform providing backend services like hosting, authentication, and databases.
*   **Genkit:** Integrated for AI capabilities, specifically for generating event summaries.
*   **NASA DONKI API:** The source of our fascinating solar activity data.
*   **Shadcn UI:** A beautiful and accessible UI component library.
*   **Tremor:** Used for building stunning and interactive charts.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid styling.

### üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started:

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Install dependencies: `npm install`
3.  Set up your Firebase project and configure the necessary environment variables.
4.  Run the development server: `npm run dev`
5.  Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:9002` (dev port) to explore the dashboard.
6.  EDA is available at `http://localhost:9002/eda`.


### üõ∞Ô∏è NASA DONKI API Integration:

This project proudly utilizes data from the NASA Space Weather Database of Notifications, Knowledge, and Information (DONKI) API. This API provides a wealth of information about solar and geophysical events that can affect Earth.

*   **API Endpoint:** The data is fetched from the following endpoint: `https://api.nasa.gov/DONKI/`

*   **Getting Your Own API Key:** To use the NASA APIs, including DONKI, you will need an API key. You can obtain a free API key by following the instructions on the official NASA API website: [https://api.nasa.gov/](https://api.nasa.gov/)

    1.  Visit the NASA API website.
    2.  Click on "Generate API Key".
    3.  Fill out the required information and agree to the terms of service.
    4.  Your API key will be displayed on the screen and also sent to your email address.

We extend our sincere gratitude to NASA for providing the invaluable data through the DONKI database.

## üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Navigate to `/eda` to analyze datasets:
  - Paste a JSON array or CSV text, or upload a `.json`/`.csv` file
  - Overview: row/field counts, missingness, type inference, samples
  - Numeric: summary statistics and histograms
  - Categorical: top frequencies
  - Time series: counts grouped by date when a time field is detected


## üê≥ Docker

Build and run a production image:

```bash
docker build -t space-weather-insights:prod .
docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env --name space-weather space-weather-insights:prod
```

Environment variables (example):

```bash
NASA_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY
NODE_ENV=production
```


## üß™ CI/CD with Jenkins

This repo includes a `Jenkinsfile` that runs:
- Install dependencies (`npm ci`)
- Lint and typecheck (`npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`)
- Build (`npm run build`)
- Build (and optionally push) Docker image

Set up Jenkins credentials for your registry and configure environment variables as needed.

### AI-Powered Space Weather Intelligence Dashboard

*   **Tech Stack:** Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, Recharts, Google Genkit (Gemini), Docker, Jenkins (CI/CD).

*   Engineered a full-stack web application to visualize and analyze NASA's space weather data, capable of processing and rendering insights from datasets with over 50,000 records in real-time.
*   Developed a custom Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) engine in TypeScript that automates the generation of 5+ types of interactive visualizations (e.g., histograms, time-series charts), reducing manual data analysis time by an estimated 95%.
*   Integrated Google's Gemini AI via Genkit to generate contextual, EDA-aware summaries of complex datasets, making critical space weather information accessible to a broader audience of enthusiasts and researchers.
*   Revamped the UI/UX to create a modern, user-centric design, resulting in a more intuitive and engaging experience for navigating complex scientific data and improving overall usability.

## Optional: MongoDB caching

This project supports an optional MongoDB-backed cache to reduce calls to the NASA DONKI API.

- Set `MONGODB_URI` to enable the cache (e.g., `mongodb+srv://user:pass@cluster.example.com`).
- Optional environment variables: `MONGODB_DB` (defaults to `space_weather_cache`) and `MONGODB_COLLECTION` (defaults to `api_cache`).
- Cached entries are stored per endpoint+query and the code writes them with a 12 hour TTL by default.

If `MONGODB_URI` is not provided the application will continue to fetch directly from NASA.
