# **App Name**: Space Weather Insights

## Core Features:

- Event Dashboard: Dashboard for viewing various types of space weather events: Geomagnetic Storms, Interplanetary Shocks, Solar Flares, Solar Energetic Particles, Magnetopause Crossings, Radiation Belt Enhancements, and High-Speed Streams.
- Event Details: Display event details for each type of space weather event, including start and end dates, locations, and any relevant catalog information. This should use a clearly laid-out and readable design, allowing easy parsing of individual data items.
- Date Range Selector: Date range selection to allow users to specify a custom date range for retrieving data (limited to a maximum of 30 days) to remain aligned with initial implementation.
- AI Insights: Natural language insights. Summarize key details from the Space Weather Insights, providing context and relevant data for review.
- Source Link: Provide a link for each event that redirects to the original NASA DONKI source URL (when available).
- Search Bar: Search bar tool: Enable the user to filter the dataset via keywords in the title/description

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep space blue (#243A73) to evoke a sense of space and the unknown.
- Background color: Very dark gray (#222222) to create a high-contrast, dark mode experience, highlighting the data points.
- Accent color: Electric purple (#BE31EB) as a striking accent to draw attention to important data points and interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif, for a modern, neutral, readable interface.
- Use clean, outlined icons related to space weather phenomena (e.g., sun flares, geomagnetic waves) to represent different data categories.
- Use a card-based layout to present individual space weather events, making it easy to scan and digest information.
- Subtle transition animations for loading data and expanding event details to enhance user experience without being distracting.
